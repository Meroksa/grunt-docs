Here are the changes:

* Allow usage of grunt plugins that are located in any location that
  is visible to Node.js and NPM, instead of node_modules directly
  inside package that have a dev dependency to these plugins.
  (PR: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/pull/1677)
* Removed coffeescript from dependencies. To ease transition, if
  coffeescript is still around, Grunt will attempt to load it.
  If it is not, and the user loads a CoffeeScript file,
  Grunt will print a useful error indicating that the
  coffeescript package should be installed as a dev dependency.
  This is considerably more user-friendly than dropping the require entirely,
  but doing so is feasible with the latest grunt-cli as users
  may simply use grunt --require coffeescript/register.
  (PR: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/pull/1675)
* Exposes Grunt Option keys for ease of use.
  (PR: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/pull/1570)
* Avoiding infinite loop on very long command names.
  (PR: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/pull/1697)
* Dependency updates are also included.

You can find Grunt on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt) and [GitHub](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt).
